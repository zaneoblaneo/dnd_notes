## Description
A crippled squirrel-folk man with the ability to see into the future. [[Rin]] Killed him at one point ([[Aurelia]] brought him back), he died while reading [[Seebo]]'s palm([[Aurelia]] brought him back again), and [[Taku]]/[[Kasper]] threw him down some stairs re-crippling him. Last seen at the K-9 Practice. I have no idea why he puts up with us.
