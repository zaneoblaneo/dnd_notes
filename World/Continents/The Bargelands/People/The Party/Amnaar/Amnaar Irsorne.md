## Description
As far as he knows, Amnaar is a 3 foot tall Gnorf Druid who weighs approximately 100lbs. He has a dark red beard, really rough tan skin, and is balding a bit. He isn't the sharpest tool in the shed, but he makes up for it with his life experiences. He has tan skin, and has a bit of a history when it comes to substances. He is the new owner of the [[Elven High-life]] since his parents died a couple weeks ago. He has some dope ass black leather armor with wooden spikes, and a gnarled oak quarterstaff. He met [[The Party]] shortly after sleeping off the bender he went on when his parents died. He seems to have really taken a liking to [[Seebo]] seeing as he's an artist with metal as opposed to my plants. 

## Secrets
Amnaar has one secret that even he doesn't know yet. During that bender he was on, he had overdosed, and was given a second chance. When the time is right, his body will transform into a form that he thought he had only dreamt of.
