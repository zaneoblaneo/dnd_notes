Kovara Kiefa Mo Drug keeps coming up in the book. Can't decipher what that
title is, but I can translate that silver is the purity that comes with
changes in your life, and copper is sorrow for things that must be done.

Kovaran use masks to hide identities because those who do what is required
have a duty to hide selves from people who don't appreciate it. 

Drug shows up a LOT but I can't crack what it means. It seems to be the
driving force. Seems to be negative. Reality seems to hate the idea of Drug
When drug is inacted reality tries to prevent it. Sometimes creating rifts
between worlds. Whatever opened the door for me to get here was BIG.

Copper masks with silver tears are willing to take the sorrow for the
betterment of others. Really into the cult.

Kovara Kiefa Mo Drug kondu mi kinee was said in a booming voice as I flew to the 
top of the sand pit (Drug - Cataclysm | Kinee - Salvation)
