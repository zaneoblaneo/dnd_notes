# Description
An invisible tower of unknown size that used to be located in the ocean off of the shore of the Bargelands. It was a law enforcement hotspot that was used to contain artifacts of unknown origin (Such as the [[Puzzle Box]])

# Battle of the Tower of Mirrors
[[The Party]] attempted to go to the tower of Mirrors to find an artifact known as the [[Puzzle Box]] without knowing what that entailed. As we arrived, the tower guards held us hostage as a battle broke out between cultists, and the tower guards (+ the [[Mage Hunters]]). We hid in a dome, and waited for the Tower of Mirrors to be sunk. The place where the tower once stood, shot a beam of red light into the sky, turning the sky red.
