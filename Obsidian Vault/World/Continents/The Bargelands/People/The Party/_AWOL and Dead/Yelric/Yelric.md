# Description
I am Yelric Tathronn, I am a 5'11" Summer Eladrin. I originated from the fey wilds where I was an aspiring musician, and made my way into Keldaras through an accidental rift created by some masked [[Cultists]] a couple of years ago. I am interested in the magic that they used to pull me here. It could be fun if used correctly. I tracked them into The Bargelands, where I ended up working with this old man named [[Scraggle]]. He paid me to help convince people to sign away their souls, and to have them break their NDAs. 


There've been a couple Raccoons that have been popping by the shop, and I don't know what to think of them yet, but Scraggles gets all weird and "NDA-y" when I brought them up. I followed them around town for a while, and watched them kill 3 men. I want to help old Scraggles out, but I don't think I can take the two coons that killed 3 men by myself.
